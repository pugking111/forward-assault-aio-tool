# 🎮 Forward Assault AIO Tool

Welcome to the last app you'll ever need for Forward Assault Remix. It’s like a Swiss Army knife, but instead of opening bottles, it opens stat sheets, flings credits, and gives your KD a makeover. No, it won't make you better at the game — but it will make your stats *look* like you are.

## 🤖 What This App Does (a.k.a. Features)

- 💰 **Credit Launcher 9000™**
  - Slam credits into your account like it owes you money.
  - Set custom or “I’m feeling greedy” target credit values.
  - Cooldowns included so you don’t melt the servers (or your conscience).

- 📊 **Stat Surgery**
  - Edit kills, deaths, headshots, and all the ego metrics that matter.
  - Comes with built-in sanity checks to keep you from becoming statistically immortal (we tried, trust us).

- 🧙‍♂️ **Theme Wizardry**
  - Switch between themes because default is boring.
  - Toggle dark mode to feel like a hacker in a movie from 1999.
  - Save your login info with encryption strong enough to keep out your nosy little brother.

- 🛸 **Auto-Updater (Space-Age Technology)**
  - Launches, checks GitHub, downloads updates, and installs — like magic, but with more logs.
  - May or may not trigger your Windows Defender into thinking it’s Skynet. False alarm.

- 🖥️ **Tray Mode Ninja**
  - App hides in your system tray like it’s on stealth mode.
  - One click to reappear. Two clicks? Still one click, actually.

## 🛠 How to Install This Digital Sorcery

> This is a Windows-only party. Sorry Mac and Linux — maybe next season.

1. [Download the latest `.exe` installer](https://github.com/pugking111/forward-assault-aio-tool/releases/latest)
2. Run the installer (double-click like a boss).
3. Launch the app. Bask in its glow. Try not to giggle.

## 🔄 Auto-Updater: What Is This Sorcery?

The app peeks at a magic file called `version.json` on GitHub. If it spots a newer version, it politely downloads the installer, then boots your current session out the back door.

**version.json (for those who code dangerously):**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.2",
  "download_url": "https://github.com/pugking111/forward-assault-aio-tool/releases/latest/download/ForwardAssaultSetup_v1.0.2.exe"
}
